Abstract: Excessive amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) can lead to eutrophication in water sources. Woodchip bioreactors have shown success in removing N from agricultural runoff, but less is known regarding P removal. Woodchip bioreactors are subsurface basins filled with woodchips installed downgradient of agricultural land to collect and treat drainage runoff. Microorganisms use the woodchips as a carbon (C) source to transform N in the runoff, with unresolved biological impacts on P. This study aims to explore microbial communities present in the bioreactor and determine whether milling woodchips to probe the microbial communities within them reveals hidden microbial diversities or potential activities. Metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were performed on six woodchip samples (i.e., three unmilled and three milled) collected from a ten-year old woodchip bioreactor treating agricultural tile drainage. All samples had similar DNA purity, yield, quality, and microbial diversity regardless of milling. However, when sequences were aligned against various protein libraries, our results indicated greater relative abundance of denitrification and P transformation proteins on the outside of the woodchips (unmilled) while the interior of woodchips (milled) exhibited more functional-gene-abundance for carbohydrate break down.  Thus, it may be important to characterize microbial communities both within woodchips and on woodchip surfaces to gain a more holistic understanding of coupled biogeochemical cycles on N, P, and C in woodchip bioreactors. Based on these findings, we advise that future microbial research on woodchips (and potentially other permeable organic materials) examine both the surface biofilm and the interior organic material during initial studies. Once researchers determine where specific proteins or enzymes of interest are most prevalent, subsequent studies may then focus on either one or both aspects, as needed.
