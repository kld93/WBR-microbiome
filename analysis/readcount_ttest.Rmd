## Data

```{r}
readcount <- read_csv("C:/github/linux_notes/DNAplot_N/Woodchip_metadata.csv") %>%
  rename(fn = filename)
```

Subset the data by treatment:
```{r}
readcount_W <- readcount %>% 
  filter(Treatment == "W")

readcount_G <- readcount %>% 
  filter(Treatment == "G")
```

plots: 
```{r}
summary(readcount_W)
summary(readcount_G)

ggplot(readcount, aes(Treatment, count)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

t-test:
```{r}
t.test(count ~ Treatment, data = readcount, alternative = "two.sided", paired = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

```{r}
t.test(log(count) ~ Treatment, data = readcount, alternative = "two.sided", paired = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

```{r}
wilcox.test(count ~ Treatment, data = readcount, alternative = "two.sided", paired = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```
