## Load packages & set directory
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(rstatix)
```

## Load data
```{r}
readcount <- read_csv("C:/Users/Katie/Documents/WBR-microbiome/data/Woodchip_DNAquality.csv") %>%
  rename(fn = filename)
```

Subset the data by treatment:
```{r}
readcount_W <- readcount %>% 
  filter(Treatment == "W")

readcount_G <- readcount %>% 
  filter(Treatment == "G")
```

plots: 
```{r}
summary(readcount_W)
summary(readcount_G)

ggplot(readcount, aes(Treatment, count)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Mann-Whitney U Tests (because this data doesn't meet assumptions for t-test)
```{r}
## read count
wilcox.test(count ~ Treatment, data = readcount, alternative = "two.sided", paired = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95, exact = FALSE)

## DNA yield (concentration)
wilcox.test(yield ~ Treatment, data = readcount, alternative = "two.sided", paired = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95, exact = FALSE)

## initial woodchip mass
wilcox.test(mass ~ Treatment, data = readcount, alternative = "two.sided", paired = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95, exact = FALSE)
```



## Stats

#### check assumptions
```{r}
## using: https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/t-test-in-r/

rpm_ppk <- dmnd_ppk

# summary stats
rpm_ppk %>%
  group_by(Treatment) %>%
  get_summary_stats(norm.count, type = "mean_sd")

# summary boxplot
ggboxplot(rpm_ppk, x = "Treatment", y = "norm.count", 
  ylab = "Reads per Million Total", xlab = "Treatment", add = "jitter")

# identify outliers
rpm_ppk %>% 
  group_by(Treatment) %>% 
  identify_outliers(norm.count) 
### The result of this function yields zero rows meaning that there were not outliers in our database.

# check normality
## The normality assumption can be checked by computing the Shapiro-Wilk test. 
## If the data is normally distributed, the p-value should be greater than 0.05.
rpm_ppk %>% 
  group_by(Treatment) %>% 
  shapiro_test(norm.count)
### the two p-values are greater than the significance level 0.05 indicating that 
### the distribution of the data are not significantly different from the normal distribution. 
### In other words, we can assume the normality.

ggqqplot(rpm_ppk, x = "norm.count", facet.by = "Treatment")
### All the points fall approximately along the (45-degree) reference line, for each group. So we can assume normality of the data.

# check equality of variances
## This can be done using the Leveneâ€™s test. If the variances of groups are equal, the p-value should be greater than 0.05.
rpm_ppk %>% levene_test(norm.count ~ Treatment)
```

#### Welch's t-test for read count per million total reads:
```{r}
t_test(norm.count ~ Treatment, data = rpm_ppk, alternative = "two.sided", paired = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
### p-value = 0.0089
### less than significance level of 0.05, so the means of the U and M groups are significantly different from each other.
```
